# pre-trip-driver-identification
Android App for driver identification using in-vehicle data

Using K-means clustering and Support Vector Machine algorithms to identify drivers based on the time difference between 6 pre-trip driver actions such as door closing, starting ignition, shifting gear, etc.

This repository contains the Android project files.

The project is in progress and this repository may not contains enough files for everyone to run.
