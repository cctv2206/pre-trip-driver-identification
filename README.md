# pre-trip-driver-identification
Android App for driver identification using in-vehicle data

Using K-means clustering and Support Vector Machine algorithms to identify drivers based on the time difference between 6 pre-trip driver actions such as door closing, starting ignition, shifting gear, etc.

This repository contains the Android project files.

The project is in progress and this repository may not contains enough files for everyone to run.

Added Matlab program for reading data from csv file, plotting data, feature extraction and parsing data.

=== 03/30/2016 ===

Added Matlab programs for identifing drivers using neural network pattern recognition and SVM.

=== 03/31/2016 ===

Added new feature: brake_value. Indicating how hard a driver push the brake when he/she shifts gear.

Added a matlab program for identifing drivers using multisvm.

Note: new feature provide us an increase of accuracy by 8%.

==================

Will be updated.

Have fun.
